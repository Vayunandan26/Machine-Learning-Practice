The result we got by using the same dataset for all the algorithms is that :
1. Decision trees was the best algorithm in terms of speed and accuracy. It also generalized the model well
2. SVM classifier took the most time which is not suitable even thought the generalization is pretty good
3. KNN overfitted the model partly because of it's insensitivty to outliers and poor understanding of the dependency between features
4. Logistic Regression performed well but the accuracy was in 80's
5. Naive bayes was the fastest but the accuracy isn't satisfying
